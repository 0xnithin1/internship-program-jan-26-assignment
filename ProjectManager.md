# Project Manager Intern Assignment (Planning + Sprints + Estimation + Risks)

## **Evaluation Criteria**

* Ability to break ambiguous work into shippable scope
* Sprint planning and prioritization across multiple projects
* Estimation thinking (assumptions, capacity, buffers)
* Risk analysis + mitigation + escalation triggers
* Communication artifacts (status update, RAID, simple reporting)

---

## **Context: 4 Projects (same scope for everyone)**

1. Video-to-Notes Platform [READ MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT](./Video-summary-platform.md)
2. LinkedIn Automation Platform [READ MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT](./linkedin-automation.md)
3. DOCX Template → Bulk DOCX/PDF Generator [READ MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT](./docs-template-output-generation.md)
4. Character-Based Video Series Generator [READ MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT](./char-based-video-generation.md)

Assume team capacity:

* 1 Backend, 1 Frontend, 1 GenAI, 1 QA (50%), 1 Designer (25%), 1 Product Manager, 1 Project Manager (You)
  Timeline: **4 weeks** (2 sprints of 2 weeks each) for an **internal demo MVP**

---

## **Problem 1: MVP Definition (1 page)**

For each of the 4 projects, write:

* **MVP scope** (3 bullets)
* **Out of scope** (2 bullets)
* **Acceptance criteria** (2 bullets)
* **Dependencies** (1–2 bullets)

**Your Solution for problem 1:**

You need to put your solution here.

---

## **Problem 2: Sprint Plan (2 sprints, 2 weeks each)**

Create a plan that delivers an internal demo MVP across all 4 projects.

Must include:

* Sprint goal for Sprint 1 and Sprint 2
* For each sprint: top epics/stories per project (bullet list)
* Cross-project “platform items” (auth, job system, storage, logging) as a shared track
* QA + hardening items in each sprint (not all at the end)

**Your Solution for problem 2:**

You need to put your solution here.

---

## **Problem 3: Estimation + Capacity** 

Provide:

* Estimation method (T-shirt sizing or story points) and why
* Capacity assumptions per role (how many days available per sprint)
* High-level sizing per project (S/M/L)
* Buffer strategy (how much and where you apply it)

**Your Solution for problem 3:**

You need to put your solution here.

---

## **Problem 4: Risk Register**

Create a risk register with **10 risks** across these projects.

For each risk include:

* Risk
* Impact (H/M/L)
* Probability (H/M/L)
* Mitigation
* Trigger signal
* Contingency / fallback

Must include risks around:

* AI output quality + review loops
* LinkedIn OAuth/token expiry + rate limits
* Bulk generation partial failures + per-row reporting
* Large video upload/storage cost + timeouts
* Background jobs stuck/retry/idempotency issues
* Privacy/PII + access control mistakes
* Scope creep across 4 parallel tracks

**Your Solution for problem 4:**

You need to put your solution here.

## **General Questions (answer briefly)**

1. If leadership wants a demo in **10 days**, which **2 projects** do you prioritize first and why?
2. What are your top **5 delivery health metrics** for this program?
3. How will you keep stakeholders aligned when requirements change mid-sprint?
4. What’s your “Definition of Done” for an AI workflow feature?
