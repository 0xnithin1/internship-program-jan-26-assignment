# Architecture: Character-Based Video Series Generator

> **Real-World Reference Implementation:**
> This architecture is based on **[LoraFrame (IDLock Engine)](https://github.com/Nithin9585/LoraFrame_)** — a project I built and presented at the **CENI AI Hackathon, Hyderabad** (Top 10 Finalist).
> LoraFrame is a persistent character memory & video generation system that combines episodic memory, LLM reasoning, and identity-preservation technology to create "permanent digital actors" that maintain visual consistency across generated images and videos.
