# **Technical Product Manager Intern Assignment**

## **Evaluation Criteria**

* Clear scope definition and tradeoffs (MVP vs v1)
* Strong PRD structure (users, problems, success metrics)
* Technical depth (SRS-level thinking without overengineering)
* Backlog grooming skill (stories, acceptance criteria, priorities)
* SOW clarity (deliverables, assumptions, exclusions)
* Product expansion roadmap (what next, why, metrics)

---

## **Context: 4 Products in the same suite**

1. Video-to-Notes Platform [READ MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT](./Video-summary-platform.md)
2. LinkedIn Automation Platform [READ MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT](./linkedin-automation.md)
3. DOCX Template → Bulk DOCX/PDF Generator [READ MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT](./docs-template-output-generation.md)
4. Character-Based Video Series Generator [READ MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT](./char-based-video-generation.md)

Assume: 1 Backend, 1 Frontend, 1 GenAI, 1 QA (50%), 1 Designer (25%), 1 Project Manager, 1 Product Manager(You)

Timeline: **6 weeks** to reach “beta-ready” for 1–2 products, and MVP for others.

---

## **Deliverable 1: Scope + Positioning (1 page)**

Pick **any ONE** product from the four and write:

* Target user + primary pain (3 bullets)
* Problem statement (2–3 lines)
* MVP scope (5 bullets)
* Out of scope (5 bullets)
* Success metrics (3 measurable metrics)
* Key risks/constraints (3 bullets)

---

## **Deliverable 2: PRD (2 pages max)**

Write a PRD for the same chosen product including:

* User personas (2)
* User journeys (happy path + 2 failure paths)
* Feature list grouped by themes
* Non-functional requirements (latency, scale, privacy, auditability)
* Analytics/events you would track
* Release plan: MVP → v1 (what changes)

---

## **Deliverable 3: SRS / System Requirements (1–2 pages)**

For the same product, define a lightweight SRS:

* Core entities (data model at high level)
* API contracts (8–12 endpoints names + 2 sample request/response)
* Background job requirements (states, retries, idempotency)
* Storage requirements (uploads, artifacts, retention)
* Security requirements (auth, access control, safe downloads)
* Error handling rules (standard error format, user-facing messages)

---

## **Deliverable 4: Backlog Grooming Pack (1 page)**

Create a groomed backlog with:

* 2 Epics
* 8–12 user stories
* Each story must include:
  * Description
  * Acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then or bullet)
  * Priority (P0/P1/P2)
  * Dependencies/notes

---

## **Deliverable 5: SOW for Beta Delivery (1 page)**

Write a simple Statement of Work for delivering beta of the chosen product:

* Goals and deliverables
* In-scope / out-of-scope
* Assumptions and dependencies
* Timeline (high level)
* Acceptance criteria
* Risks and exclusions

---

## **Deliverable 6: Product Expansion (1 page)**

For the overall suite (all 4 products), propose:

* A 90-day expansion roadmap (3 phases)
* 5 expansion ideas (prioritized) with “why” and expected impact
* Packaging/monetization suggestion (very brief)

---

## **General Questions (answer briefly)**

1. How do you decide MVP scope when stakeholders want “everything”?
2. What tradeoffs would you make if GenAI cost becomes too high?
3. How do you write acceptance criteria for AI features where outputs vary?
4. What would you cut first if timeline slips by 2 weeks?

---

## **Submission Format**

* **One PDF/DOCX, ****max 7–8 pages total**
* Bullets + diagrams allowed, keep it crisp and structured
