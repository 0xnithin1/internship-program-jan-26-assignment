# GenAI Assignment:

**Evaluation Criteria**

We will score your submission on:

* Clarity and practicality of architecture
* Robust JSON schema design
* Prompt quality (zero-shot, reliable, minimal hallucination risk)
* Handling of ambiguity + user review flow
* Bulk generation thinking (errors, naming, report)

## Problem 1: **Proposal for “Video-to-Notes”**

We have a local folder of long videos (3–4 hours each, 200MB+). Watching them fully is slow. We need an automated way to generate a “summary package” per video: **Summary.md** + highlight clips + screenshots, all organized per video. [READ MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT](./Video-summary-platform.md)

### **Task**

Prepare a **pre-processed solution proposal** comparing  **three approaches** **:**

1. **Online/Cloud-Based (Already Available Solutions)**
2. **Build Our Own Using LLM APIs (Hybrid: local media processing + cloud LLM)**
3. **Build Fully Offline Using Open-Source Models (Local transcription + local LLM + pipeline)**

No code required. We want a **clear, practical proposal** with architecture and tradeoffs.

## Problem 2: **Zero-Shot Prompt to generate 3 LinkedIn Post**

Design a **single zero-shot prompt** that takes a user’s persona configuration + a topic and generates **3 LinkedIn post drafts** in **3 distinct styles**, each aligned to the user’s voice and constraints. The output must be structured so the app can: show 3 drafts to the user. Assume we are consuming **OpenAI API / Gemini API** with **one prompt call** (no fine-tuning). Your prompt must reliably produce valid, structured output. [READ MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT](./linkedin-automation.md)

**TASK:** Write a prompt that can work.

## Problem 3: **Smart DOCX Template → Bulk DOCX/PDF Generator (Proposal + Prompt)**

Users have many Word documents that act like templates (offer letters, certificates, invoices, contracts). They repeatedly change only a few fields (name, date, amount, address, role, etc.). Doing this manually is slow and error-prone, especially in bulk. [READ MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT](./docs-template-output-generation.md)

We want a system that:

1. Converts an uploaded **DOCX** into a reusable **template** by identifying editable fields.
2. Supports **single generation** (form-fill → DOCX/PDF output).
3. Supports **bulk generation** via **Excel/Google Sheet** rows.

### **Task (No coding)**

Submit a **proposal** for building this system using GenAI (OpenAI/Gemini) for “template field detection” and “field schema generation”. We want a practical design, not code.

## Problem 4: Architecture Proposal for 5-Min Character Video Series Generator

We want to build a system that helps a user create a short video series (around **5 minutes per episode**) using predefined characters. The user defines characters (image + personality) and relationships once, then provides a short story/situation for an episode. The system outputs a complete episode package and optionally a final video. [READ MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT](./char-based-video-generation.md)

### **Task**

Create a **small, clear architecture proposal** (no code, no prompts) describing how you would design and build this system.
