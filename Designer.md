# **Designer Intern Assignment**

## **Evaluation Criteria**

* Product UX thinking (flows, IA, user states)
* Visual consistency (design system, spacing, typography)
* Interaction design (job progress, empty/error states)
* Accessibility basics (contrast, keyboard, readable UI)
* Design handoff quality (components, specs, tokens)
* Practicality (MVP-first, scalable to v1)

## **Context: 4 Products in one suite**

1. Video-to-Notes Platform [READ MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT](./Video-summary-platform.md)
2. LinkedIn Automation Platform [READ MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT](./linkedin-automation.md)
3. DOCX Template → Bulk DOCX/PDF Generator [READ MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT](./docs-template-output-generation.md)
4. Character-Based Video Series Generator [READ MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT](./char-based-video-generation.md)

Your goal: design a coherent UX and UI foundation for the suite, with deep work on one product.

## **Deliverable 1: UX Audit + Key User Flows (1 page)**

**For ** **all 4 products** **, write:**

* Primary user goal (1 line each)
* Core flow steps (5–7 steps each)
* Biggest UX risk/complexity (1–2 bullets each)
* What must be visible for trust (progress, logs, previews, audit)

---

## **Deliverable 2: Deep Design for ONE Product (Figma)**

Pick **any ONE** product and design the MVP screens.

### **Must-have screens (minimum)**

* Onboarding / entry (first screen user sees)
* Create flow (upload/connect/create)
* Job/Draft/Run status screen (progress + logs)
* Result screen (preview + download/actions)
* History list (jobs, drafts, bulk runs, episodes)

### **Must include UI states**

* Loading, empty, success, failure, retry, partial output
* Validation errors (forms)
* Permission error (access denied)

---

## **Deliverable 3: Design System Starter (1 page + Figma components)**

Create a small system that can be reused across the suite:

* Color tokens (primary/neutral/status)
* Typography scale (H1/H2/body/caption)
* Spacing scale (4/8/12/16…)
* Buttons, inputs, cards, tables, toast, modal
* Status components: progress bar, stepper, badge, timeline/log list

---

## **Deliverable 4: Interaction Notes (half page)**

For your chosen product, explain:

* How progress updates appear (polling vs live updates)
* How you keep users confident during long jobs
* What actions are allowed while processing (cancel, edit, duplicate)
* Download UX (single file vs ZIP, disabled states)

---

## **Deliverable 5: Handoff Pack (1 page)**

Provide:

* Component list + naming
* Specs for 5 key components (padding, states, typography)
* Responsive rules (desktop-first + mobile key changes)
* Accessibility notes (contrast targets, focus states, keyboard nav)

---

## **General Questions (answer briefly)**

1. How do you design UX for AI features where outputs may vary?
2. What would you prioritize if we need a demo in 10 days?
3. How do you reduce user confusion in bulk operations?
4. What are 5 UX metrics you’d track for these products?
